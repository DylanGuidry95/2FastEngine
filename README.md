# 2FastEngine
Fisrt Game Engine


This is my first attempt at a game engine utilizing the various compontes of OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW. 
The game beign showed to utilize the engine is 2Fast and is a top down racing game. There is no AI for the second car at
the moment but will be added in a later build of the game along with a new more diverse track for the cars to race around.
